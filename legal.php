									<span class="fs-21 fw-700">1.	Who We Are </span> <br>
									 <br>
									Ethereum Community Fund Network (“ECF” or “ECF.network”) is an unincorporated community-based organization funded and run by its members. ECF collects, uses, discloses, and processes the Personal Information you submit through the ECF.network website when you apply for a position. <br>
									 <br>
									 <br>
									 <br>
									<span class="fs-21 fw-700">2.	Definition Of Personal Information </span> <br>
									 <br>
									In this this Applicant Privacy Notice (the “Notice”), personal information means information that (either in isolation or in combination with other information) enables you to be directly or indirectly identified such as name, birthday, email address, postal address, contact details, gender, nationality, education information, work history, photos, certificates, references (“Personal Information” or “Data”). This Notice aims to inform you about how we collect, use, disclose and store Personal Information in our role as a controller of Personal Information when you apply for a job or submit to us an application for recruitment purposes. It also tells you how you can exercise your rights (including the right to object to some of the data handling we carry out).  More information about your rights and how you can exercise them is set out in the Section 7 below. <br>
									 <br>
									This Notice should be read in conjunction with the Terms of Use. By submitting your resume you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this Notice. Any questions, comments or complaints that you might have should be emailed to <a href="mailto:hello@ecf.network"  class="text-decoration-underline" data-title="send email">hello@ecf.network</a>  <br>
									 <br>
									 <br>
									 <br>
									<span class="fs-21 fw-700">3.	Usage Of Personal Information</span> <br>
									 <br>
									We use Personal Information to consider your application and assess your suitability. If a position that is, or may be, of interest to you requires background checks and we therefore need to perform such checks in accordance with applicable law, we will tell you about this. <br>
									 <br>
									We may also obtain data about you from other sources including recruiters, employment research firms, identity verification services, the references you provide to us, websites and other publicly accessible data on the Internet. To the extent permitted by the applicable law and depending on your future role at our company, we may collect details of professional registrations and sanctions with professional bodies.
									 <br>
									When you apply for a position with ECF or submit Personal Information in support of your application, we will tell you whether the information we are requesting is essential so that we can process your application or whether the supply of this information is optional. <br>
									 <br>
									Any other personally-identifiable information about you shall not be collected, unless you give it to ECF directly: by filling out a form, giving written feedback, communicating via third party social media sites, or otherwise communicating via any other means. <br>
									 <br>
									Our use of your Personal Information may be based on our legitimate interests in accessing appropriate professional advice and to ensure we comply with legal obligations to which our business is subject.  <br>
									 <br>
									 <br>
									 <br>
									<span class="fs-21 fw-700">4.	Sharing Your Personal Information</span> <br>
									 <br>
									Your Data might be shared with other entities for the purpose of assessing your application only.  <br>
									 <br>
									Where necessary for the management of our recruitment process, we will share your Data with our service providers and professional advisers (e.g. recruitment agencies, providers who carry out candidate assessment programs for us). <br>
									 <br>
									If we have a reasonable interest in verifying the Data (e.g. if there are indications that they are incorrect) and we have no other means to check this, we will in accordance with applicable law also contact third parties whose details you have supplied for that purpose so that we can verify Personal Information you have provided in relation to your previous employment history and qualifications. <br>
									 <br>
									Otherwise, we will not share your Personal Information with any third party unless: (a) we have your permission (for example in order to share your details with another group company for their recruitment purposes); (b) we are required to do so by law; (c) this is necessary so that we can enforce our terms of use, rights or property or the rights or property of any third party; or (d) this is (subject to the applicable laws) necessary in connection with the sale of our business or its assets (in which case your details will be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchaser’s advisers and will be passed to the new owners).  <br>
									 <br>
									 <br>
									 <br>
									<span class="fs-21 fw-700">5.	How Long Do We Retain Your Personal Information</span> <br>
									 <br>
									We usually retain information supplied by job applicants for no longer than it is necessary to process your application within the recruitment decision. If your application is unsuccessful we retain your personal data in accordance with the applicable retention period depending on the applicable law. We may also decide to retain your details for longer if we think you may be suitable for another position that may arise in the future, provided you give us your consent. <br>
									 <br>
									If your application is successful, relevant information will be used to administer your subsequent involvement and will be retained and used in accordance with our worker privacy policies (which we will make available to you when you begin to provide services). <br>
									 <br>
									Some information may be deleted automatically based on specific schedules. Other information e.g. account information, may be retained for a longer period of time based on the agreement you will have with us when you provide services. Finally, we may further retain information for business practices based on our legitimate interests or legal purposes, such as record-keeping, or enforcing our legal rights. <br>
									 <br>
									 <br>
									 <br>
									<span class="fs-21 fw-700">6.	Security </span> <br>
									 <br>
									We use appropriate technical, organizational, and administrative security measures to protect any Personal Information we store from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. <br>
									 <br>
									 <br>
									 <br>
									<span class="fs-21 fw-700">7.	Your Privacy Rights and How To Exercise Them</span> <br>
									 <br>
									Subject to applicable law, you may have some or all of the following rights in respect of your personal information:  <br>
									 <br>
									—	(i) to obtain a copy of your Personal Information together with information about how and on what basis that Personal Information is processed;  <br>
									 <br>
									—	(ii) to rectify inaccurate Personal Information (including the right to have incomplete Personal Information completed);  <br>
									 <br>
									—	(iii) to erase your Personal Information (in limited circumstances, where it is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or processed);  <br>
									 <br>
									—	(iv) to restrict processing of your Personal Information where: a. the accuracy of the Personal Information is contested; b. the processing is unlawful but you object to the erasure of the Personal Information; or c. we no longer require the Personal Information but it is still required for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim;  <br>
									 <br>
									—	(v) to challenge processing which we have justified on the basis of a legitimate interest (as opposed to your consent, or to perform a contract with you);  <br>
									 <br>
									—	(vi) to withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Information (where that processing is based on your consent);  <br>
									 <br>
									—	(vii) to object to decisions which are based solely on automated processing or profiling;  <br>
									 <br>
									European residents: if you are a European resident, there are some exceptions to these rights under the GDPR and applicable local laws. For example, it will not be possible for us to delete your Data if we are required to keep it by law (e.g. where retention of your Data is required by law for tax and bookkeeping obligations) or if we hold it in connection with a contract with you. Similarly, access to your Data may be refused if making the information available would reveal personal information about another person or if we are legally prevented from disclosing such information. <br>
									 <br>
									California residents: California residents have specific rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (‘CCPA’).  For more information and to exercise your rights, please click on this link (Ins LINK) for further information about your privacy rights. <br>
									 <br>
									United Kingdom residents: If you are a resident of the United Kingdom, please click on this link (Ins LINK) for further information about your privacy rights. <br>
									 <br>
									To exercise any of the above-mentioned rights, you can get in touch with us using the details set out below. When addressing us, please always provide your name, address and/or email address as well as detailed information about the change you require. <br>
									 <br>
									We remind you that you have a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority should you feel unsatisfied with our treatment of your Personal Information.  <br>
									 <br>
									 <br>
									 <br>
									<span class="fs-21 fw-700">8.	International Data Transfers</span> <br>
									 <br>
									Where your Personal Information you send us in support of your application is transferred by us or our service provider(s) outside the European Economic Area (EEA), and where this is a country which is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission, we protect your privacy adequately by entering into EU approved contractual clauses with service providers operating outside the EEA or a service provider’s Processor Binding Corporate Rules. For further information, including how to obtain a copy of the documents used to protect your information, please contact us as described in the “Contact Us” section below. <br>
									 <br>
									We will always protect your Personal Information in accordance with this Notice wherever it is processed. We do not voluntarily or actively transfer or disclose your Personal Information to the government or law enforcement authorities (the “Authorities”) and/or otherwise grant any Authorities access to your Personal Information. In the event of a request from the Authority, we have procedures and controls in place to make sure that any such request is assessed according to the procedure. <br>
									 <br>
									 <br>
									 <br>
									<span class="fs-21 fw-700">9.	Updates</span> <br>
									 <br>
									The ECF.network website may evolve over time, and this Notice will change to reflect that evolution. This Notice may be updated periodically. We will update the date at the bottom this page accordingly and encourage you to check for changes that we have made, which will be available at https://ecf.network/legal.php. On some occasions, we may also actively advise you of specific data handling activities or significant changes to this Notice, as required by applicable law. <br>

									  <br>
									  <br>
									  <br>
									<span class="fs-21 fw-700">User Generated Content </span><br>
									  <br>
									If it is the case that you supply and/or upload any content to the Site – whether it be pictures, text, sound recordings or otherwise – the content you supply (“User Generated Content”) must comply with the following rules: <br>
									  <br>
									— it must not be obscene, abusive, offensive or racist and it must not promote or propose hatred or physical harm against anyone; <br>

									— it must not promote or condone terrorism, violence or illegal behaviour. <br>
									  <br>
									You agree that any User Generated Content complies with those standards. <br>
									  <br>
									If you are acting for purposes relating to your trade, business, craft or profession (a "Business User"), you will be liable to us and indemnify us for any losses, liabilities, damages, fines, penalties, expenses or costs ("Losses") that we may suffer or incur in connection with any failure of the User Generated Content to comply with these standards. <br>
									  <br>
									We reserve the right to refuse or accept, remove or refuse or cease to use any User Generated Content supplied by any person that we think contravenes these standards. We also have the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any User Generated Content posted or uploaded by you to the Site constitutes a violation of their rights (including intellectual property rights or rights to privacy). <br>
									  <br>
									You acknowledge, understand and agree that other users of the Site may upload or supply their own User Generated Content on the Site. We are under no obligation to review, validate or correct any User Generated Content posted by you or by any other user of the Site, and under no circumstances will be responsible or liable to you or any third party for the content or accuracy of any User Generated Content posted on the Site. We give no guarantee that any User Generated Content will be free from errors or omissions. <br>
									  <br>
									  <br>
									  <br>
									<span class="fs-21 fw-700">Interactive Services </span><br>
									  <br>
									In addition, we may from time to time provide interactive services on the Site that shall enable you to upload User Generated Content, including, without limitation, comment facilities, chat rooms and/or bulletin boards (together "Interactive Services"). <br>
									  <br>
									Where we provide an Interactive Service, we will use reasonable endeavours to provide information to you about the kind of service offered and if it is moderated. However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any Interactive Service we provide. <br>
									  <br>
									The use of any of our Interactive Services by a minor is subject to the consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who permit their children to use an Interactive Service that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online. Minors who are using any Interactive Service should be made aware of the potential risks to them. <br>
									  <br>
									  <br>
									  <br>
									<span class="fs-21 fw-700">Viruses </span> <br>
									  <br>
									We do not guarantee that the Site will be secure or free from bugs or viruses. You are responsible for configuring your information technology, computer programs and platform in order to access the Site. You should use your own virus protection software. <br>
									  <br>
									You must not misuse the Site by knowingly introducing viruses, trojans, worms, logic bombs or other material which is malicious or technologically harmful. You must not attempt to gain unauthorised access to the Site, the server on which the Site are stored or any server, computer or database connected to the Site. You must not attack the Site via a denial-of-service attack or a distributed denial-of service attack.
